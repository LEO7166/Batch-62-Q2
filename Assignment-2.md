**API (Application Programming Interface):** An API is a set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate and interact with each other.  It acts as an intermediary, defining how different software components exchange data and functionality. Think of it as a menu in a restaurant – it lists what's available (functions/data) and how to order it (request format).  APIs abstract away the underlying implementation details, allowing developers to focus on the functionality rather than the internal workings.

**SDK (Software Development Kit):** An SDK is a collection of tools and resources that developers use to create software applications for a specific platform or technology.  It often *includes* APIs, but also provides additional resources like libraries, documentation, code samples, and debugging tools.  Essentially, an SDK makes it easier to use an API by providing pre-built components and support.  An analogy would be a toolbox – it contains various tools (APIs, libraries, etc.) to build something (an application).

**Web APIs:** These are APIs specifically designed for communication over the internet using standard web protocols like HTTP. They are commonly accessed using methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to retrieve, send, update, or delete data.  RESTful APIs are a popular architectural style for web APIs, emphasizing simplicity and statelessness. JSON or XML are commonly used for data exchange in web APIs.  Examples include Twitter's API for accessing tweets or Google Maps API for embedding maps.

**Library APIs:** These are APIs within a programming library that provide pre-written functions and classes that developers can incorporate into their own code.  They are typically accessed within the same programming environment as the application itself (e.g., a JavaScript library used in a web application).  Library APIs focus on providing reusable components, making development faster and more efficient.  Examples include jQuery (JavaScript), NumPy (Python), and React (JavaScript).  The distinction between a library API and a web API is primarily about the *access method* – one is within a programming environment, the other across the internet.

**Prompting and Completion:** This is a paradigm typically associated with large language models (LLMs).  A *prompt* is an input given to the LLM, such as a question, a command, or a piece of text.  The *completion* is the LLM's generated output in response to the prompt.  This interaction is often mediated through an API –  developers send prompts to the LLM's API, and receive a completion as a response.  Effective prompting involves crafting inputs that clearly and concisely communicate the desired output from the LLM. This area is crucial in developing applications that leverage the capabilities of LLMs.  The API handles the communication and execution of the prompting and completion process.
