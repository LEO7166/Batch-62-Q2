## Messages

This refers to the conversational turns in a chat-based AI interaction. Each message is a unit of communication, typically containing a user's prompt or the AI's response. The history of messages forms the context for the current interaction.

## Model

This refers to the specific large language model (LLM) being used. Different models (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4, LLaMA) have different architectures, training data, and capabilities. The choice of model affects the quality, style, and capabilities of the generated text.

## Max Completion Tokens

This parameter limits the length of the AI's response. Tokens are units of text, typically words or parts of words. A higher token limit allows for longer, more detailed responses, while a lower limit results in shorter, more concise answers. Exceeding the token limit will truncate the AI's response.

## n

This parameter, often denoted as `n` or `num_beams`, refers to **beam search** in the context of text generation. Beam search is an algorithm that explores multiple possible sequences of words simultaneously. A higher `n` value explores more possibilities, potentially leading to higher-quality but slower generation. `n=1` is equivalent to greedy search (selecting the most likely word at each step).

## Stream

This refers to the method of receiving the AI's response. In "streaming" mode, the response is generated and delivered incrementally, word by word or phrase by phrase. This allows the user to see the response as it's being generated, rather than waiting for the complete response. Non-streaming mode provides the complete response at once.

## Temperature

This parameter controls the randomness of the AI's output. A temperature of 0 results in deterministic output (always choosing the most likely word), producing predictable but potentially less creative text. Higher temperatures (e.g., 0.7 or 1.0) introduce more randomness, leading to more creative and surprising but potentially less coherent text.

## Top_p (Nucleus Sampling)

Similar to temperature, `top_p` controls the randomness of the AI's output, but in a different way. Instead of controlling the probability distribution directly, `top_p` considers the cumulative probability of the most likely words until their cumulative probability reaches `top_p`. Only these words are considered for the next token selection. This method often produces more focused and coherent text than temperature alone. A lower `top_p` value leads to more deterministic output.

## Tools

This refers to the external tools or functionalities that an AI model can access and utilize to enhance its capabilities. For instance, tools might include web search, calculators, code execution, or access to specific databases. The use of tools allows the AI to perform more complex tasks and provide more informed responses.
